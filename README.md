# 💼 AFTA Salary Loan Calculator

This project is a modular full-stack application built during the AFTA Bootcamp. It consists of:

- 🖥️ **Frontend**: A user-friendly **Streamlit** interface for calculating monthly loan repayments based on salary.
- ⚙️ **Backend**: A scalable **FastAPI** service for handling API requests, ready for features like user authentication, storing loan applications, and more.
- 🐳 **Dockerized**: Each part of the project is containerized using Docker, with a `docker-compose.yml` file to orchestrate both services.
